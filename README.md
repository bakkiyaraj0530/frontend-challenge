# Vimcar Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Vimcar Coding Challenge!

The challenge is here to get a basic understanding of your current knowledge and skills. It is not needed to make this a 100%
functional and fully working online shop. We want to see how you think and solve problems you may come across the way.

Feel free to use any frameworks/libs of your liking to achieve this (except some, see [Rules](#Rules) below).
You can use Angular, React, Ember or even other languages like PureScript, TypeScript, Elm etc.

When you are done, either upload your finished challenge to github and let us know, or send us the source code directly to `martin.broder@vimcar.com`

## What should be done

The challenge is to code a really simple shop with the following features:

- Add to Cart button
- Cart that counts and shows the added items
- The items should be removable again from the cart

The option to 'remove' an item from the cart again is missing in the layout, so it is up to you how you solve this problem.

## Rules

- shouldn't take longer than 2-3 hours (let us know before you start!)
- clear, structured, consistent code that follows best practices
- no use of jQuery, Bootstrap, "Regular" CSS (use Sass, LESS or else)
- allowed to use any lib/framework EXCEPT jQuery/Zepto or Bootstrapping frameworks like Bootstrap/Foundation etc.
- the source must be written in English, no language-specific variables like `const HoeheMalBreiteMalTiefe = 'DREITAUSEND MAL FUENFUNDZWANZIG'`.
- you are allowed to use a bootstrapping repo to get started quickly (like [react-starter](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit))
- have fun!
