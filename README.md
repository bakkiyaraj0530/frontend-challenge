# Vimcar Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Vimcar Coding Challenge!

The challenge is here to get a basic understanding of your current knowledge and skills. It is not intended to make this a 100% working and fully functional online shop.
We want to see how you think and solve common problems.

Feel free to use any frameworks/libs of your liking to achieve this (except some, see [Rules](#rules) below).
You can use Angular, React, Ember or even other languages like PureScript, TypeScript, Elm etc.

When you're finished, either upload your challenge to github and let us know, or send the source code directly to `martin.broder@vimcar.com`

## Rationale

Notice that this challenge has nothing to do with what we do, it's rather an experiment to see how you structure your application,
namespace things and think about strategies to solve typical problems.

## What should be done

The challenge is to code a really simple shop with the following features:

- "Add to Cart" button
- A cart that counts and shows the items added by the user
- The items should be removable again from the cart
- Stick to the [design](https://github.com/vimcar/frontend-challenge/tree/master/design)

The option to 'remove' an item again is missing in the layout, so it is up to you how to handle this.

## Rules

- Shouldn't take longer than 2-3 hours - let us know before you start!
- Clear, structured, consistent code that follows best practices.
- No use of jQuery, Zepto, Bootstrap etc.
- Source Code must be written in English, no language-specific variables like `const HoeheMalBreiteMalTiefe = 'DREITAUSEND MAL FUENFUNDZWANZIG'`.
- You are allowed to use a quickstarter repo to get started quickly, e.g. [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- Have fun!
